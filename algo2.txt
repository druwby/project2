Algorithm 2: Vibe Check - Card Shuffle 🃏🔥
You and your friends are playing a trendy card game, but there's a catch—you need to
organize the deck before the game starts. You are given an integer array hand, where
hand[i] represents the number on the i-th card. You also have an integer groupSize, which
determines how many cards should be in each valid group.
A valid group must follow these rules:
● Each group has exactly groupSize cards.
● The cards in a group must be consecutive in value (increasing by 1 each time).
Your task? Check if it's possible to rearrange the deck into valid groups. If yes, return true,
otherwise return false.
Input Format:
● An integer array hand of size N (1 ≤ N ≤ 105), where hand[i] represents the card
values.
● An integer groupSize (1 ≤ groupSize ≤ N).
Output Format:
● Return true if the cards can be perfectly grouped as per the rules.
● Otherwise, return false.
Sample 1:
Input: hand = [1, 2, 3, 6, 2, 3, 4, 7, 8], groupSize = 3
Output: true
Explanation: The cards can be arranged as [1,2,3], [2,3,4] and [6,7,8]
Sample 2:
Input: hand = [1,2,3,3,4,5,6,7], groupSize = 4
Output: false
Explanation: The closest we can get is [1,2,3,4] and [3,5,6,7], but the cards in the
second group are not consecutive.
